    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using
        the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is
        layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
        
        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but
        using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The modern
        croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
        yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked
        dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
        Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants sold
        in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
